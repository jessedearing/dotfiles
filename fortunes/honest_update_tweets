Turns out we weren't better at running this than that vendor we shrugged off.

This outage brought to you by the race to finish quarterly goals before the quarter ends.

We'll get this fixed once we find someone who can decipher the regex.

This'll be the outage that has us change the MoTD in prod.

The incident has aged out of our Slack logs, so nobody has a clue how to fix it this time.

It worked in QA!

Sometimes you just have to laugh and restore the backup.

Sorry for the delay in response, but we just realized or leadership team never came back from that planning retreat.
