These are my public dotfiles, there are many like them but these are
mine.

Notes
-----

###Tmux
The .tmux.conf file was copied from [pengwynn](https://github.com/pengwynn/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.tmux.conf).
The prefix key is Ctrl-a instead of Ctrl-b.

###(G)Vimrc
I use the an early variation of the vimrc and gvimrc from
[Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus). I do not actually use
Janus, rather I use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to
maintain my git plugins. All the plugins are set up as git submodules

###Irbrc
This file requires that `wirble` and `awesome_print` gems are installed.

###Zshrc
My zshrc is tailored to work with [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
