These are my public dotfiles, there are many like them but these are
mine.

Notes
-----

###Tmux
The .tmux.conf file was copied from [pengwynn](https://github.com/pengwynn/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.tmux.conf).
The prefix key is Ctrl-a instead of Ctrl-b.

###(G)Vimrc
I use the [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) package for Vim so my rc is tailored to work with it.

###Irbrc
This file requires that `wirble` and `awesome_print` gems are installed.

###Zshrc
My zshrc is tailored to work with [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
